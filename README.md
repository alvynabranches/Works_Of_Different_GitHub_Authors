I have made this repository just so that users get all the content in one place and does'nt have to search much.
<br>
I'll be uploading all new repositories as I am learning, so that it can be a help for you too.

<b>Finally, Ill only say not to copy the code from these repositories, or if has done, then please give them the credit.</b>
Its hard to be a researcher, and it takes lot of time and efforts to put the source codes. <b>Please do take off the hard work from the authors.</b>
